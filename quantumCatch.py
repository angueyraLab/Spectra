# Tsujimura (2015): 
# In the case of zebrafish, all the four subtypes of RH2 are expressed in the short (or accessory) member of double cones (SDCs) and both two LWS subtypes are expressed in the long (or principal) member of double cones (LDCs)
# However, they are differentiated in the expression pattern in the retina [13]. 
# Fish eyes continue to grow through the lifetime by adding new cells to the peripheral zones [17]. 
# Concomitantly, early-expressed subtypes are located centrally in the adult retina. 
# The shortest wavelength RH2 subtype (RH2-1) is expressed earliest and in the central to the dorsal area of the adult retina. 
# The second shortest wave subtype (RH2-2) is expressed subsequently overlapping with RH2-1 but extending outside of it. 
# The longer wave RH2 subtype (RH2-3) is expressed later and in a region surrounding the RH2â€“2 area, and 
# the longest wave RH2 subtype (RH2-4) is also expressed later and outside of the RH2-3 area, broadly occupying the ventral area. 
# Similarly, the shorter wave LWS subtype (LWS-2) is expressed earlier and in the central-to-dorsal area in the adult retina, 
# and the longer wave LWS subtype (LWS-1) is expressed later in the development and confined peripherally with largely occupying the ventro-nasal area of the adult retina [13]
